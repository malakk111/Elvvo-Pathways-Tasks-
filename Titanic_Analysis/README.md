# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore patterns related to passenger survival.

## Project Overview
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, standardized data, and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generated descriptive statistics and examined survival rates across factors like gender, passenger class, and embarkation port.
- Visualizations: Built plots to highlight relationships and correlations, including survival by gender and class.
- Key Insights: 
  - Females had higher survival rates compared to males.
  - Passengers in higher classes were more likely to survive.
  - Embarkation port showed variations in survival distribution.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
